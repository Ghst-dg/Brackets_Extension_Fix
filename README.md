if you getting this message "unable to access the extension registry" on your Brackets file manager

first get this config.json file on your pc then find the bracket installation on your system. Find and open "www" folder then replace the config.json file with this config.json.

for eg:-
i have bracket installation on Program Files in C drive
so i open to :C\Program Files\Brackets\www
then i replace the config.json present there with this config.json
restart brackets
